# Overview
## The analysis of the school district results was repeated to account for the dishonestly reported results of the Thomas High School ninth graders. The analysis seeks to understand the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, the average math and reading scores at each grade level from each school, and the impact of spending, school size and school tyep of students grades. Finally, the analysis seeks to understand how the removal of the Thomas High School ninth graders' grades impacts the school district results
